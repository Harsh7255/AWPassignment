    <br>
    <p>Engineering is one of the most singled out professions in the present day. There are a lot of students who look
      forward to follow their dreams by choosing career as an engineer. The study of engineering can endow with
      simulating challenges, prospect to be resourceful and most of all, can lead to an exhilarating and gratifying
      career. However, before aspiring to become an engineer and jumping on to any decision, it is sensible to get an
      idea on a whole about this profession. Fundamentally, to put it in a straight way, engineering is where you solve
      problems by analyzing the constraints and apply science. To add a bit more to it, engineers use methodological, as
      well as systematic knowledge in order to make judgments. By using their imaginations, they come up with solutions
      to problems either new or old.

    <h2>FACTS OF MEDICAL COLLEGES</h2>
    <P>The Medical Council of India and the Dental Council of India were set up under
      ACTs of Parliament with a view to regulate medical and dental education in the country.
      Under the provisions of Regulations of the two statuary bodies, no medical or dental college can be established or
      increase their capacity without prior approval of the Central Government. As per section 10A of the Indian Medical
      Council Act, 1956 and the Destistry Act, 1948, the Central Government’s permission to such colleges are granted
      initially for one year, i.e., for admitting only one batch of students in a calendar year. The permissions are to
      be renewed on yearly basis after verification of achievements of annual targets. This process is continued till
      such time the full
      required infrastructure is created and recognition is granted under the relevant Act.</P>
